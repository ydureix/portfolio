--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
The assignment took around 12 hours to finish. It was worked on throughout the deadline week.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
In this assignment I mostly used WSC resources to learn about how to use different tags and ways to structure my html and CSS.
I used ChatGPT to help debug my code when I got stuck. I used queries such as "How do I center content in html and css". The list of sites I visited includes:

1. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp
2. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp
3. https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp
4. https://www.w3schools.com/css/
5. https://www.w3schools.com/html/



5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
One of my classmates suggested I use bootstrap to help with my webpage. I ended up not using bootstrap since I was able to figure out how to make the webpages responsive using @media settings.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Nothing special just make sure to have the images for my placeholder pictures in the file otherwise it will not load the images correctly.
